Computers are useless.  They can only give you answers.
Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork.
We have computers, and we may have other weapons of mass destruction.
That's what's cool about working with computers.  They don't argue, they remember everything, and they don't drink all your beer.
If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside.
I've noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture.  Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS.
The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.
It's ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes.  You know, less than a compact disc.  The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute.
Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window.
Hardware: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked.
Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
The Internet?  Is that thing still around?
Any fool can use a computer.  Many do.
There are only two industries that refer to their customers as âusers'.
Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots.  So far the Universe is winning.
That's the thing about people who think they hate computers.  What they really hate is lousy programmers.
Don't worry if it doesn't work right.  If everything did, you'd be out of a job.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing.
First learn computer science and all the theory.  Next develop a programming style.  Then forget all that and just hack.
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.
Should array indices start at 0 or 1?  My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.
There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.
I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn't show up in a Unix directory listing.
There is no programming languageâno matter how structuredâthat will prevent programmers from making bad programs.
Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++?
In C++ it's harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do, you blow off your whole leg.
One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was thatâlacking zeroâthey had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs.
Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like.  But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN'T be like.
If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution.
Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.
The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 10% of the development time.  The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
I don't care if it works on your machine!  We are not shipping your machine!
There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
You can either have software quality or you can have pointer arithmetic, but you cannot have both at the same time.
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
Windows NT addresses 2 Gigabytes of RAM, which is more than any application will ever need.
Keyboard not found. Press < F1 > to RESUME.
Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.
Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.
bug, n: An elusive creature living in a program that makes it incorrect. The activity of ""debugging"", or removing bugs from a program, ends when people get tired of doing it, not when the bugs are removed.
Don't get suckered in by the commentsâ they can be terribly misleading. Debug only code
If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong.
Once you're done writing the code, never open it again unless you want to see how uncomprehensible and utterly ridiculous it really is.
The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.
The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree, is by accident. That's where we come in; we're computer professionals. We cause accidents.
Sometimes I believe compiler ignores all my comments
<!-- Here be dragons  -->
You don't need luck. You need enough firepower.
This Game isn't about peace so "make war"
I have always wished for my computer to be as easy to use as my telephone; my wish has come true because I can no longer figure out how to use my telephone.
The gap between theory and practice is not as wide in theory as it is in practice.
There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX. We don't believe this to be a coincidence.
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you areâby definitionânot smart enough to debug it.
If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0
Rules of Optimization: Rule(1) : Don() 't do it.    Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet.
Programming can be fun, so can cryptography; however they should not be combined.
Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
I just saw my life flash before my eyes and all I could see was a close tagâ¦
Java: write once, debug everywhere.
All methodologies are based on fear.
Real programmers don't document. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.
If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it?
There are two kind of sysadmins: Paranoids and Losers.
